    <h4 className="FAQ">How do I use the app?</h4>
    <p>You need to be connected to the live Ethereum network or the Ropsten test network. Easiest way is to have the Chrome Extension Metamask installed, and just press Command + Shift + R (refreshes page and clears cache) on the
      homepage if it says 'No Networks Detected'.</p>
    <p>If you don't have Injected Web3 like Metamask, then it will attempt to connect to a local node running on
      localhost:8545</p>
      <p>The app works on both Ropsten & Mainnet, so you can test it out on Ropsten before you use real ETH.</p>

    <p>And of course this website component is only providing a friendly UI for interacting with the smart contract, you can always transact with the smart contract directly.</p>

    <h4 className="FAQ">Where is the contract?</h4>
      <p>Here are both versions verified on <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x459f90b6e8dc23bbf1ff4c2f22aa2149b4bd4cff">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xcf9f3f8f8b5bf5ed72bd3fdb66c29e36675c9d2b" target="_blank">Ropsten Etherscan</a>.</p>

    <h4 className="FAQ">Anything else I should know?</h4>
    <p>Not a need to know, but you can deposit multiple times to the smart contract and it will update the stored balance but
      still keep the original withdrawal date.</p>
    <p>And also as a safety check for bad user inputs (like someone putting an extra digit), the smart contract will not accept
    future dates of more than 5 years from the time of the transaction.</p>
